# Animated Landing Page

This is a repository for an animated landing page built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The landing page utilizes the "Animate on Scroll" (AOS) library by Michal Sajnóg, which allows for easy animation effects triggered by scrolling.

- Smooth scrolling: The landing page provides a seamless scrolling experience that enhances user engagement.
- Responsive design: The page is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a great experience across different devices and screen sizes.
